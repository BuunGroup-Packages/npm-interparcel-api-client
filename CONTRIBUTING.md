## ‚ú® Contribution Guidelines

### ‚úÖ Before You Start

- Ensure your change is related to a GitHub issue or opens a new one with context.
- Open a discussion if you're unsure whether your contribution would be accepted.
- Make sure you pull the latest `main` branch before branching.

### üåø Branching Strategy

- Create a new branch from `main`:

  ```
  git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
  ```

  Use these prefixes:
  - `feat/` for new features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes
  - `chore/` for maintenance or tooling
  - `docs/` for documentation updates
  - `test/` for test-related changes

---

## üì¶ Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode is enforced.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Follow existing code style (run `npm run lint`).
- Format code with Prettier (run `npm run format`).
- **All code must be linted and formatted before submitting a PR.**
- The CI will fail if code is not properly linted or formatted.

- `feat: add createShipment method`
